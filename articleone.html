  <p>Last season, an NFL team won 10+ games for the 15th straight regular season.  They finished with the second highest scoring offense in the NFL, and they led the league in yards from scrimmage.  That team advanced to the Super Bowl for the third time in four years, where they scored 33 points and threw for over 500 yards against a top 5 defense.</p>

  <p class="article">The season was largely considered a failure by both fans and media.</p>

  <p>Welcome to life as the New England Patriots, where anything short of a Lombardi Trophy is a disappointment.</p>



  <p>31 teams in the NFL would kill to have double digit wins and the reigning league MVP.  They’d enter the offseason flying high, knowing they have the best player in the league under center, with dreams of returning to the big game.</p>

  <p>The Patriots are different.  Instead of the optimism that most teams would’ve had entering the offseason, the feeling around Gilette Stadium has seemed more like a funeral, with somber questions outnumbering any encouraging answers.   Is the Patriots dynasty coming to an end before our eyes?  Is Bill Belichick still a genius?  Did the Pats make the wrong decision in choosing Tom Brady over Jimmy G? Since the Pats moved atop the NFL hierarchy, this is the normal state of mind of Patriot Nation.</P>

  <p>Nothing they do can be described as ordinary.  When they win, it’s a proclamation that confirms everything we think about them.  The greatest dynasty in NFL History.  The smartest head coach ever.  Tom Brady, the GOAT..</p>

  <p>But when they lose? Oh boy.</p>

  <p>Fall to the Giants on two last minute drives?  The Pats choked.  Get upset by the Jets in a Foxborough playoff game? Rex Ryan had Bill Beclichick’s number.  Lose to dominant Ravens and Broncos defenses in the AFC Title game?  The Pats are soft.  On and on it goes, bitter endings making way to apocalyptic storylines.</p>

  <p>Super Bowl or bust, year after year.  And it’s not just the team that faces unfair expectations; it extends to the players as well.</p>

  <p>Randy Moss spent 3 full seasons in New England.  He averaged 83 catches, 1,200 yards, and 15 touchdowns per season.  But, in the eyes of us Pats fans, the hall of famer’s Patriots career is widely considered a failure, because he never won a ring.</p>

  <p>Logan Mankins spent 9 seasons in Patriots Red, White and Blue, where he made 6 Pro Bowls and 6 All-Pro teams.  He’ll likely be enshrined in the Hall of Fame because of his accolades in New England.  But like Moss, he never lifted a Lombardi, and therefore his Patriot legacy will forever feel like a disappointment.</p>

  <p>The same can be said for countless other Patriots from the last two decades:  Wes Welker, Junior Seau, and Aqib Talib to name a few.  Potential hall of famers who contributed to dominant teams, only to never reach the peak of the sport, and therefore are widely disregarded for their place in Patriots lore. </p>

  <p>This brings us back to February 4th, 2018, and everything that’s surrounded the Patriots since they fell just short of a sixth Super Bowl title.  Yes, the Patriots were unsuccessful in their bid to repeat as Super Bowl champions.  Yes, there have been hints of internal conflict that hasn’t been heard in Foxborough since Bob Kraft bought the team in 1994.  And yes, there’s a certain handsome Quarterback now playing in San Francisco instead of New England.</p>

  <p>Aren’t these good problems to have?  The chance to win back-to-back titles means you were the defending champs to begin with.  Organizational infighting is inevitable when you have three men (Brady, Belichick, and Kraft) at the top of their professions, who have earned the right to own massive egos.  And before we crown him the next Joe Montana, let’s make sure that Jimmy Garoppolo can lead a team to playoffs, and isn’t simply the next Matt Cassel.</p>

  <p>So instead of losing our collective minds and calling into WEEI at the first sign of trouble this year, let’s do two things:</p>

  <p>First, let’s all agree that this has been, and continues to be, one hell of a ride.  No team in NFL history (and very few in any professional sport) has enjoyed the kind of run that the current Patriots are on.  15 division titles in 17 years, with 5 World Championships to show for it.  The greatest coach and player in their sport’s respective history, partnered together for nearly two decades.  Someday this will all be over, and when it is, I want to know that I appreciated it every step of the way.  I want to enjoy every game, every minute, and every play that this dynasty has left in it.</p>

  <p>Number two…it ain’t over yet.  As long as number 12 is under center and the hoodie is roaming the sidelines, we know the Patriots will contend.  We know they’ll ignore the outside noise, we know that they’ll do their jobs, and we know that they’ll win.</p>

  <p>Is it January yet?</p>
